The SYDI project has received a lot of praise from its users. These are a few examples of what people are saying:

- Kevin Howard, Citrix Enterprise Administrator at IBM Global Services - USA

<strong>"I can't tell you how much time and effort I have saved in documenting my network with your tools. Keep up the great work!"</strong>- Phil Mandryk, Network Coordinator at at Trinity College School – Ontario, Canada

<strong>"Your scripts for creating documentation are spectacular! It makes things very easy for a large company with no documentation or even a small company with no real writers the power to easy and quickly document their servers. At this rate, there should never be a lack of documentation; well at least not in my environment!"</strong>- Robert Spilman, Sr. Network Engineer at GTSI Corp. – USA

- Don Krause, Network Engineer – Wisconsin, USA

<strong>"SYDI is a really cool application, both in its simplicity and in the valuable information output"</strong>- Martin Kaae, IT Manager at Danish Toxicology Centre - Denmark

<strong>"Keep up your good work, the industry needs guys like you"</strong>- Richard Laniel, Software Developer at Rocksoft – Québec, Canada
