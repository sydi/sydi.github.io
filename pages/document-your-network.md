<strong>SYDI</strong> is the open source project aimed to help you to document your network.

<h3>How does SYDI do this?</h3>

At the most basic level SYDI consists of a collection of scripts which collects information from your servers and networks, then writes the data to a report.

Documenting a network can seem like a huge project, SYDI helps you get started. Instead of manually collecting information like ip addresses, os version, hardware configuration the scripts collects this automatically it can write directly to Word (or XML).

<h3>Letâ€™s get started!</h3>

To start documenting take a look at <a href="http://sydiproject.com/products/sydi-server/" title="SYDI-Server">SYDI server</a> head to the <a title="Download SYDI" href="http://sydiproject.com/download">download section</a>, and document away.
