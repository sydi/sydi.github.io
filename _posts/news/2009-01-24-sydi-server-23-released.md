I've just released [SYDI Server](http://sydiproject.com/products/sydi-server/) 2.3.

This is the change log for this release:

* Added Product Keys (-rk) for Windows and Office to SYDI Server (based on script by [Parabellum](http://www.visualbasicscript.com/m_42793/mpage_1/key_/tm.htm)
* Added Product Key tab in SYDI Overview
* Added IP Subnets in SYDI-Overview
* Added Errorlevel 999 when script fails to connect to target computer
* Added link to patches when viewing xml files in a browser
* Added German language file for ss-xml2word.vbs (by Jan Picard)
* Removed Copyright character from xml files (bug)


All of the above has been added after getting feedback from users. So if there's something you want to have implemented there's a good chance it won't happen unless you tell me about it.

Anyway I hope you like the new version, if you have any thoughts please post a comment below.
