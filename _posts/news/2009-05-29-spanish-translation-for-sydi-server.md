SYDI-Server collects information through WMI queries and can write a report to XML or Word, which can be used as a [server documentation template](http://sydiproject.com/guides/server-documentation-template/) or as a starting point for your network documentation. When writing output to XML you can use the [ss-xml2word.vbs](http://sydiproject.com/tools/ss-xml2word/) script in order to create a Word file in your language. This is assuming there is a translation file for your language.

Carlos de Blas Cart√≥n has created a Spanish file for SYDI. It's currently available through the translation pack on the [download page](http://sydiproject.com/download/), but will be included in future versions of SYDI-Server.

Thank you Carlos for contributing to the project! Unfortunately I don't understand Spanish myself, but I hope others will find it useful.

So now we have nine translation files, the other ones are: Danish, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and of course Swedish :)

If you want another language it's really easy to create one. Just open the lang_english.xml file in notepad and compare it to one of the other ones. Even if you don't understand the other language you will see what to do.
